# levels
hello! welcome to level making & scripting, as you may not want to read this project's source, I have put basic documentation here.


### tools
* any IDE/text editor
* use the [Tiled editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/)\
  or if you feel insane, manually edit the TXL/XML files :D

### ⚠️ limits
before you start, i want to acknowledge that this is **not Haxe**, but **hscript**, an interpreted version of Haxe, meaning you will lack types, enums*, classes, and [more details here](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hscript).

*though enums aren't supported, you can definitely use them and get their name via `Std.string(FancyEnum)`/`Enum.get(FancyEnum)`, just not make them.

# introduction
to interact with the game in your level, you will use the global `Game`.

## Events
