# contributions
feel free i don't mind!!!\
but i would appreciate if you followed these **code guidelines**:
* indented with **2 spaces** instead of 4 spaces,\
  totally fine if you don't like it
* used **snake_case for variables** and **PascalCase for classes/types**,\
easier to differenciate and causes less conflicts

don't commit random README.md changes though
