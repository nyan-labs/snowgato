# contributions
feel free i don't mind!!!\
but i would appreciate if you followed these **code guidelines**:
* indented with **2 spaces** instead of 4 spaces,\
  totally fine if you don't like it
* used **snake_case for variables** and **PascalCase for classes/types**,\
easier to differenciate and causes less conflicts

for **levels**:
* read `LEVELS.md`
* not every single one will get approved!\
  **if** i decide to add a level browser, then this will be irrelevant

don't commit random README.md changes though
